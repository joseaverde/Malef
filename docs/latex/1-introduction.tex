\section {Introduction}
   \subsection {What is Malef?}
   \paragraph{}
      \textbf {Malef} is a 'TUI' library written in Ada with bindings for other
   languages such as C or Python. TUI stands for \textit{Text User Interface}.
   TUI programs have the advantage of being way simpler to code and have fewer
   dependencies than any other GUI application. That's the purpose of Malef,
   being able to run anywhere suiting the needs of the program to the
   capabilities of any terminal available. Hiding all the complicated stuff
   allowing you to write any kind of application like you were writing a GUI,
   but with the simplicity of a TUI.

   \subsection{Tell me how to get it}
   \paragraph{}
      First go to the GitHub repository in
   \url{https://github.com/joseaverde/Malef} and download it. You can either
   clone it with the \textit {git clone} command or download it from the
   releases section on the GitHub page. There are some precompiled packages
   with instructions for different platforms, but if you want to build it
   yourself continue reading.

   \paragraph{}
      Once you've downloaded it and extracted it, you have to compile it.
   Read the README.md file for more information.
