bug_c_null-surface	Problems with surface initialization in C binding	[DONE]
malef_tests	Add tests to Malef parent package	[DONE]
bug_compile_c_bool	When compiling the library in older compilers (maybe GNAT 7), the bool type declared in the C Intefaces package is defined as a unsigned char. Therefore it does not allow for expressions such as "if is_true then". Fix it!	[DONE]
bug_null_colours	Change the background and foreground colours from the null surface when the default palette is change or the library is initialized, that way the conversion is faster.	[DONE]
bug_py_colors_for_in	'for i in range c:' where c is of type Color raises a BoundsError, EDIT: the error was found, it's .tp_iter 's problem, but it requires you to create a new PyObject which I'm not willing to do for the moment. It has been fixed by changing the raised extension from BoundsError to IndexError which is the one the general purpose iterator looks for, that way we have avoided writing a new iterator object for both Palettes and Colors.	[DONE]
typos_1	Fix PROGRAMMES typos!	[DONE]
ada_bug_subsystems_missing_libraries	When there are missing libraries the library runs without raising any error, fix that!	[DONE]
ada_direct_colors	Add functions to the Malef.Colors package where it takes as argument a Color_Kind and a Boolean (Brightness level), so the user doesn't need to index the Palette directly.	[DONE]
py_colors_iterations	Make Python objects such as: Color, Palette, ColorEnum, PaletteEnum and Surface iterables.	[DONE]
python_bug_object_type	There is a bug with functions that take as a parameter an object, because if you for example feed it an integer instead of a colour it will eat it and will corrupt the Surface!	[DONE]
doc_project	Change the location of the Project information to a different file from the README.md file.	[TODO]
doc_build_instructions	Add information about how to build it to the README file.	[TODO]
bell_sound	Add bell sound function.\a	[TODO]
ada_volatile	This library can be used to change things from the system in a very unsafe way, that way the user will have complete control of the library. For example, it can be used to use certain colours or to check against certain styles.	[TODO]
colors_cmd	Add colour support for CMD!	[TODO]
py_malef_database	Create a database of terminals that can be read by the program, and be able to find information about the terminal using other souces such as terminfo in case the terminal data couldn't be retrieved.	[TODO]
colors_doc	Add documentation for colours package!	[TODO]
pakages_creator	Create a package creator for package managers such as dpkg or pacman.	[TODO]
doc_latex	Create documentation written in LaTeX	[TODO]
c_separate_library	Separate C library as a another file.	[DONE]
malef_config	Create a file that prints configuration flags.	[TODO]
readme.md	Add README.md file to every directory.	[TODO]
c-gpr	Add different gpr file for C binding	[DONE]
py-gpr	Add different gpr file for Python binding, don't use setup.py	[DONE]
py_rename	Rename everything to be called PyMalef.	[DONE]
bug_windows_linker	When compiling the library with Windows, it will try to search for the libraries it's linked to but won't find them. Compile it statically.	[TODO]
