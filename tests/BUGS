This is a list of **bugs** found with tests:

[py][malef.getWidth][FIXED][Returned malef.getHeight instead.]
[all][malef.systems][FIXED][Error with None subsystem.]
[all][malef.systems.prepare_terminal][Can't initialise after finalising because of null pointers to strings (Stty_Path, Tput_Path)]
[all][malef.systems.utils][When library was finalised subsystems weren't unloaded and thus they couldn't be loaded again]
