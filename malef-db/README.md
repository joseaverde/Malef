Malef Database
==============
   This directory contains the information about different terminals and which
are their capabilities. These sources will be later compiled by a python script
and loaded at runtime by the Malef Initialisation system.

   These files are called *".mdbraw"*, and when compiled *".mdb"*. As the
library is always evolving, there will be a script to update the source files
(update.py)[update.py] and one to autogenerate them (gen.py)[gen.py], the
compiler is (compile.py)[compile.py].

## File format
   These files follow a very simple format:

### Comments
   Comments start with an exclamation sign **!**, everything from there to
another exclamation point will be ignored.

### Assignment
   The other thing it can do is assign values, the syntax is very simple:
> *Identifier* **=** *Expresion*
> *Expresion* := *Identifier*|**(***Identifier*, ...**)**|*Number*|*Keyword*|*String*|*Boolean*
> *Identifier* ~ /.+/
> *Number* ~ /[0-9]+/
> *Boolean* ~ /(True|False)/
> *String* ~ /".+"/
> *Keyword* := (Any of the defined keywords that are generated by the generator
or the updater, the information given there may be enough).

   I don't know how this has to be written but I'll add an explanation just in
case:
   * The **:=** means **it is**
   * The **|** means **or**
   * Anything in bold means it has to be written as it is (in Markdown bold is
   marked by surrounding the word by asterisks).
   * The three points **...**, means more or none of the last element type may
   follow.
   * The **~** means it matches something in Regex.
   * The things that are not in italics should be written as they are.
   * Everything is case sensitive.


### For example:

```
! This is a comment
Bit8 = True    ! It shouldn't accept any other type.
Hola = "Spanish"  ! This variable is stored by the compiler it won't be
                  ! compiled, only keyword's values will be compiled.
```
